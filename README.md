# Quiz_competition
'''''''''''''''''
Quizzes are the funniest part of learning and that too combined with competiton gives **extra enthusiasm**.
This project is made for one such competition held in my college and being a coordinator its my responsibilty to conduct it by technical means.
This project involves the *html*, *css* and *javascript* used as basic frontend static webpages to generated a browser based quiz enviorment.

**HTML** -> used as structuring the elements.

**CSS** -> used for giving it colours and themes.

**JAVASCRIPT** -> to provide basic functionality.
